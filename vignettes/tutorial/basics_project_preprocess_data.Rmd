One can perform dataset preprocessing inside the feature functions (e.g. clustering GPS points).
But if this takes a long time and is done again and again for different feature functions, it can be useful to perform preprocessing on the dataset once. 
To make sure that this is done for each grouping variable individually, it is safer to use the method shown here.
