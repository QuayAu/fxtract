Title: Feature Extraction from Grouped Data
Date: 2019-02-07
Description: Similar to the summarize functionality of dplyr, this package is used on grouped data.
    The user can simply add functions which have an output of a named vector.
    In some machine learning contexts this functionality plays a big part in the feature extraction process.
    Very large datasets are supported, since data is only read into RAM when needed.
    Calculation can be done in parallel and the process can be monitored.
    Results are available in one final dataframe.
Version: 0.9.1
