Title: Feature Extraction for Longitudinal Data
Type: Package
Description: This package helps with extracting features from longitudinal data of many different users/IDs/etc.
    Helpful preprocessing functions are supplied as well. Very large datasets are supported, since data is only read into RAM when needed.
    Individual features can be deleted or updated easily. Calculation of features can be done in parallel and the process can be monitored.
    Results can be easily collected in one final dataframe.
