Title: Feature Extraction from Grouped Data
Date: 2019-02-07
Description:  An R6 implementation for calculating features from grouped data.
    The output will be one row for each group.
    This functionality is often needed in the feature extraction process of machine learning problems.
    Very large datasets are supported, since data is only read into RAM when needed.
    Calculation can be done in parallel and the process can be monitored. 
    Global error handling is supported.
    Results are available in one final dataframe.
Version: 0.9.1
